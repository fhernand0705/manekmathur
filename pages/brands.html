             <p>
               Post surgery, I found that my sensation in the left foot was lacking. After giving Naboso’s insoles a try,
               I found an immediate improvement in balance and stability.
               Naboso focuses both at the medical level as well as the performance level on optimizing movement and motor coordination through the stimulation of your nervous system.
